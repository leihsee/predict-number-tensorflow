This project predicts number
1.png --> Script predicts it as 1, it's true it looks like handwriting of 1 also looks like print form
2.png --> Script predicts it as 4, it's also true  it looks like handwriting of 4 also looks like print form
3.png --> Script predicts it as 5, because it looks like the handwriting of 2, and also curves may be help it in prediction
4.png --> Script predicts it as 5, beacuse it looks like not fully closed
5.png --> Script predicts it as 3, very crooked
6.png --> Script predicts it as 5, because its circle look like 3 circles
7.png --> Script predicts it as 2, because  the lower one is not as long as 7
8.png --> Script predicts it as 1, because it looks like handwriting 1
9.png --> Script predicts it as 3, because it looks like handwriting 3, and down side may help it to predict 3
10.png --> Script predicts it as 5, because it looks like print form of 5
